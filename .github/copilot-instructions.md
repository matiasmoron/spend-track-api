ðŸ§± Project Structure & Clean Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles and is organized as follows:

src/
â€¢ application/: Contains business logic.
â€¢ use-cases/: Each use case has its own folder and file (e.g., CreateExpense.ts, GetGroupsByUser.ts).
â€¢ errors/: Custom application errors.
â€¢ domain/: Entities and repository interfaces.
â€¢ entities/: Plain TypeScript classes or value objects (e.g., Expense.ts, User.ts, Group.ts).
â€¢ repositories/: Interfaces for repositories (e.g., UserRepository.ts, ExpenseRepository.ts).
â€¢ value-objects/: Domain-specific enums or strong types (e.g., Currency.ts, GroupType.ts).
â€¢ infrastructure/database/:
â€¢ models/: TypeORM entity definitions (e.g., UserModel.ts).
â€¢ repositories/: TypeORM-based implementations of domain interfaces.
â€¢ services/: AuthService and others tied to infrastructure.
â€¢ interfaces/http/:
â€¢ controllers/: Handles HTTP requests (e.g., UserController.ts).
â€¢ routes/: Express routers.
â€¢ validators/: DTO validations using class-validator.
â€¢ utils/: Shared utilities for HTTP layer.
â€¢ shared/: Helpers, logs, or generic functions.
â€¢ types/: Global or cross-cutting types.
â€¢ config/: Initialization (e.g., express.ts, database.ts, di.ts).
â€¢ tests/:
â€¢ unit/: One file per use case.
â€¢ integration/: Uses a TestEnvironment singleton with DB transactions.

âœ… Best Practices

Naming
â€¢ Use PascalCase for types, classes, enums.
â€¢ Use camelCase for variables and functions.
â€¢ File names match the class or use case (e.g., CreateGroup.ts, GroupModel.ts).

Use Cases
â€¢ Each use case must:
â€¢ Receive typed Input and return typed Output.
â€¢ Be placed under src/application/use-cases/<entity>/.

Entities
â€¢ Domain entities should use constructor injection via a Props object (e.g., UserProps, ExpenseProps).
â€¢ createdAt and updatedAt should be readonly when not passed from external sources.

DTOs
â€¢ Validation is done using class-validator decorators.
â€¢ Add explicit error messages.
â€¢ Only data transformation/validation logic allowed.

ðŸ”„ Testing

Unit Tests
â€¢ One test file per use case under tests/unit/application/use-cases/<entity>.
â€¢ Follows AAA structure (Arrange, Act, Assert).

Integration Tests
â€¢ Use the shared TestEnvironment class.
â€¢ Each test:
â€¢ Starts a transaction (queryRunner.startTransaction()),
â€¢ Rolls back after test (queryRunner.rollbackTransaction()),
â€¢ Uses /register and /login to get a test user and JWT.

CLI

Run tests:

yarn test # all tests
yarn test:unit # only unit
yarn test:integration # only integration

ðŸ”§ Other Details
â€¢ Express App is initialized via initExpress() inside src/config/express.ts.
â€¢ Dependency injection is managed in src/config/di.ts.
â€¢ AuthService uses a JWT_SECRET from .env and must be defined during test and deploy.

ðŸ¤– Copilot Tips
â€¢ Use TestEnvironment for any integration test helpers.
â€¢ Always return BaseResponse.success or BaseResponse.error from controllers.
â€¢ Avoid direct use of models in use cases â€” use repositories instead.
â€¢ Use Currency and GroupType enums where appropriate.
â€¢ Validate DTOs using validateDTO(dtoClass, data) helper.
