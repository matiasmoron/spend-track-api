## 🏢 Project Architecture

The project follows **Clean Architecture** principles, separating responsibilities into clear layers:

```
src/
├── application/          # Use cases and custom errors
│   └── use-cases/
│       ├── user/
│       └── group/
├── domain/               # Entities and repository contracts
│   ├── entities/
│   └── repositories/
├── infrastructure/       # DB connection and real implementations
│   ├── database/
│   │   ├── models/
│   │   └── repositories/
├── interfaces/           # Entry/exit interfaces (HTTP layer)
│   ├── controllers/

```

## 🔧 Available Scripts

```bash
yarn dev              # Start server with ts-node-dev
yarn build            # Compile the project

yarn lint             # Run ESLint
yarn format           # Run Prettier

yarn test             # Run all tests
yarn test:unit        # Run unit tests only
yarn test:integration # Run integration tests only
```

---

## 📊 Testing

Tests are split into:

- **Unit tests**: each use case is tested in isolation
- **Integration tests**: test endpoints with Express + real DB + JWT auth

Directory structure:

```
tests/
├── unit/
├── integration/
│   ├── groups/
│   └── users/
└── shared/           # Test helpers and environment
```

Integration tests use DB transactions + rollback for clean state.
